# The PIVOT Framework: AI-Enhanced Strategic Thinking

Business leaders have always faced complexity. What's new is our ability to address these perennial problems with powerful AI tools that expand our thinking beyond traditional limits.

The PIVOT Framework empowers executives to harness AI as a thinking partner through a structured five-step process:

## What is PIVOT?

PIVOT stands for:

* **P**roblem Definition: What problem are we really trying to solve?
* **I**deation: What possibilities haven't we considered?
* **V**ulnerability Analysis: What could go wrong with our approach?
* **O**ptimization: How do we combine the best elements into a coherent strategy?
* **T**esting: How can we test this quickly with minimal risk?

This framework isn't about surrendering decision-making to algorithms. It's about using AI strategically at each step to enhance human judgment, challenge assumptions, and expand our thinking.

## Why PIVOT Works: The Benefits

The PIVOT Framework delivers several critical advantages for executive teams:

1. **Expanded solution space**: Break out of fixed thinking patterns to consider novel approaches
2. **Reduced cognitive bias**: Challenge assumptions and generate alternatives to counteract natural biases
3. **Accelerated decision cycles**: Explore more options in less time, allowing for faster adaptation
4. **Risk analysis**: Systematically catch potential failures before they occur
5. **Practical experimentation**: Emphasize quick, low-cost testing rather than big, risky bets

## Getting Started with PIVOT

Each step of the framework includes specific AI prompts designed to enhance your strategic thinking:

Begin with the [setup prompt](setup.md) to establish your business context, then work through each step sequentially.

1. [Problem Definition](problem-definition.md) - Reframe challenges from multiple perspectives
2. [Ideation](ideation.md) - Use "what if" scenarios to generate unexpected solutions
3. [Vulnerability Analysis](vulnerability-analysis.md) - Conduct pre-mortems to identify potential failure points
4. [Optimization & Synthesis](optimization.md) - Combine the best elements into a coherent strategy
5. [Testing & Validation](testing.md) - Design small-scale experiments to validate assumptions
