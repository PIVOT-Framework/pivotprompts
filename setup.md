## Example: Foggy Coast Brewing

Throughout the PIVOT Framework documentation, we use a fictional craft brewery called Foggy Coast Brewing to illustrate real-world applications.

**Company Profile:**

**Current Business Challenge:**
Foggy Coast Brewing has experienced strong growth locally (35% year-over-year in the Bay Area) but is now facing crucial decisions about scaling approach for national expansion. Production capacity is currently limited to 10,000 barrels annually at their single brewing facility.
