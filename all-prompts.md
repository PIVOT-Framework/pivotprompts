# PIVOT Framework: All Prompts

This file contains all prompts for the PIVOT Framework process in sequence, with minimal explanation.

## Setup

```
I'd like to analyze my business using the PIVOT strategic thinking framework. First, let me provide context about my company:

COMPANY PROFILE:
- Company name: [Your company name]
- Industry: [Your industry]
- Years in operation: [Number of years]
- Current market focus: [Geographic regions or customer segments you currently serve]
- Annual revenue range: [Approximate revenue]
- Number of employees: [Employee count]

CURRENT BUSINESS CHALLENGE:
[Describe the specific growth challenge, market expansion, product development, or strategic decision you're currently facing in 2-3 sentences]

KEY GOALS:
- [Primary business goal]
- [Secondary business goal]
- [Additional goal if applicable]

POTENTIAL OBSTACLES:
- [Major obstacle #1]
- [Major obstacle #2]
- [Major obstacle #3]

Please confirm you understand my business context before we begin the PIVOT analysis.
```

## Step 1: Problem Definition (P)

```
For the PROBLEM DEFINITION phase of the PIVOT framework, help me reframe my business challenge from multiple perspectives.

In this phase, we want to ensure we're addressing root causes, not just symptoms. Please help me look at our challenge of 
[briefly restate challenge] 
from at least 5 different perspectives:

1. From our customers' perspective
2. From our competitors' perspective
3. From our employees' perspective
4. From our suppliers'/partners' perspective
5. From an industry analyst's perspective

For each perspective, identify what they might see as the root cause of our challenge and generate a reframed problem statement.

Which of these reframed problem statements do you think gets closest to the root cause and why?
```

## Step 2: Ideation & Divergent Thinking (I)

```
Now for the IDEATION phase of the PIVOT framework, I'd like to explore unconventional possibilities using "what if" scenarios.

Please generate creative solutions to our reframed problem 
[insert the selected problem statement from the previous step] 
using these extreme "what if" scenarios:

1. What if we had to solve this with zero financial investment?
2. What if we had to grow 10x in the next 12 months?
3. What if our top competitor suddenly entered our exact market space?
4. What if we had to completely pivot to a new business model?
5. What if we could only keep one product/service offering?

For each scenario, provide 2-3 unexpected but feasible ideas. Don't worry about being practical yet - we're looking for creative thinking that breaks us out of fixed patterns.
```

## Step 3: Vulnerability Analysis (V)

```
For the VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS phase of the PIVOT framework, let's perform a pre-mortem on our most promising ideas.

From the ideation phase, these seem to be our most promising approaches:
- [List 2-3 ideas you selected from the previous phase]
- [List 2-3 ideas you selected from the previous phase]
- [List 2-3 ideas you selected from the previous phase]

For each approach, please conduct a pre-mortem analysis by assuming the approach has failed completely one year after implementation. Generate:

1. 5 most likely reasons for failure
2. The stakeholders who would be most affected by each failure point
3. Early warning indicators we could monitor to detect problems
4. A severity ranking for each potential failure (High/Medium/Low)

Based on this vulnerability analysis, which approach appears to have the most manageable risks?
```

## Step 4: Optimization & Synthesis (O)

```
For the OPTIMIZATION & SYNTHESIS phase of the PIVOT framework, help me combine the best elements from our analysis into a coherent strategy.

We've identified these key insights:
- Problem reframing: [Insert key insight from Problem Definition]
- Creative approaches: 
    - [List 2-3 ideas you selected from the previous phase]
    - [List 2-3 ideas you selected from the previous phase]
    - [List 2-3 ideas you selected from the previous phase]
- Risk awareness: [Insert key insights from Vulnerability Analysis]

Please help me synthesize these elements into a cohesive strategic approach by:

1. Identifying the 3-5 core components that should be part of our final strategy
2. Suggesting how these components complement each other
3. Proposing a logical sequence for implementation
4. Recommending key metrics we should track for each component
5. Suggesting potential resources or capabilities we'll need to develop

What would you title this synthesized strategy to capture its essence?
```

## Step 5: Testing & Validation (T)

```
For the final TESTING & VALIDATION phase of the PIVOT framework, help me design small-scale experiments to test our strategy with minimal risk.

Please design 3-4 minimum viable experiments we could conduct in the next 30-60 days to test the critical assumptions of our strategy. For each experiment:

1. Identify the specific assumption being tested
2. Describe the experiment design (who, what, when, where, how)
3. Define clear success criteria and metrics
4. Estimate resources required to run the experiment
5. Suggest how we might rapidly iterate based on results

How would you prioritize these experiments, and why?
```
