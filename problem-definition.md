# PIVOT Framework: Problem Definition (P)

The first step of the PIVOT Framework focuses on reframing your business challenge from multiple perspectives. This approach helps executive teams break free from limited viewpoints and uncover the true nature of the problems they face.

## Why Problem Definition Matters

When faced with complex business challenges, executives often rush to find solutions before properly understanding the problem. This common trap leads to wasted resources, failed initiatives, and persistent issues that never seem to go away.

As management guru Peter Drucker observed, "The most serious mistakes are not being made as a result of wrong answers. The truly dangerous thing is asking the wrong question."

## The Problem Definition Process

### Step 1: State the initial challenge
Begin by clearly articulating the challenge as you currently understand it. This provides a starting point, not the final definition.

### Step 2: Reframe from multiple perspectives
Use AI to view your challenge through the eyes of different stakeholders, including customers, competitors, employees, suppliers/partners, and industry analysts.

### Step 3: Identify underlying assumptions
Surface and challenge the assumptions embedded in how you initially framed the problem.

### Step 4: Synthesize insights into a refined problem statement
After exploring multiple perspectives and challenging assumptions, redefine the problem more accurately.

## AI Prompt for Problem Definition

```
For the PROBLEM DEFINITION phase of the PIVOT framework, help me reframe my business challenge from multiple perspectives.

In this phase, we want to ensure we're addressing root causes, not just symptoms. Please help me look at our challenge of 
[briefly restate challenge] 
from at least 5 different perspectives:

1. From our customers' perspective
2. From our competitors' perspective
3. From our employees' perspective
4. From our suppliers'/partners' perspective
5. From an industry analyst's perspective

For each perspective, identify what they might see as the root cause of our challenge and generate a reframed problem statement.

Which of these reframed problem statements do you think gets closest to the root cause and why?
```

## Practical Tips for Problem Definition

As you apply the Problem Definition phase to your own challenges, keep these principles in mind:

1. **Start broad, then narrow**: Begin with expansive reframing before focusing on specifics.
2. **Challenge orthodoxies**: Use AI to question "the way we've always done things."
3. **Seek diverse input**: Involve stakeholders with different backgrounds and perspectives.
4. **Test your framing**: Ask "If this is the real problem, what assumptions am I making?"
5. **Revisit periodically**: Problem definitions should evolve as you learn more.
