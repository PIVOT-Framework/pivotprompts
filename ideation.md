# PIVOT Framework: Ideation & Divergent Thinking (I)

The second step of the PIVOT Framework focuses on expanding your solution space through creative "what if" scenarios. This process helps break fixed thinking patterns and generate unexpected solutions that might otherwise remain hidden.

## Why Ideation Matters

Traditional brainstorming methods often produce predictable results because participants remain constrained by:
- Industry orthodoxies ("that's not how things work in our business")
- Resource constraints ("we don't have the budget for that")
- Cognitive biases (anchoring on first ideas, confirmation bias, etc.)

The PIVOT Ideation phase uses AI to break through these limitations by forcing consideration of extreme scenarios that push thinking beyond comfortable boundaries.

## The Ideation Process

### Step 1: Start with your refined problem statement
Use the problem statement you developed in the Problem Definition phase as your starting point.

### Step 2: Apply "what if" scenarios
Consider how you would solve the problem under various extreme conditions or constraints.

### Step 3: Generate multiple solutions for each scenario
Develop 2-3 creative but potentially feasible approaches for each scenario.

### Step 4: Identify the most promising and surprising ideas
Look for solutions that challenge your assumptions but could actually work.

## AI Prompt for Ideation

```
Now for the IDEATION phase of the PIVOT framework, I'd like to explore unconventional possibilities using "what if" scenarios.

Please generate creative solutions to our reframed problem [insert the selected problem statement from the previous step] using these extreme "what if" scenarios:

1. What if we had to solve this with zero financial investment?
2. What if we had to grow 10x in the next 12 months?
3. What if our top competitor suddenly entered our exact market space?
4. What if we had to completely pivot to a new business model?
5. What if we could only keep one product/service offering?

For each scenario, provide 2-3 unexpected but feasible ideas. Don't worry about being practical yet - we're looking for creative thinking that breaks us out of fixed patterns.
```

## Advanced Prompt Variation

For more focused innovation, you might try this advanced variation:

```
What if the craft beer industry was disrupted by a major shift toward alcohol-free alternatives within 18 months? Generate 7 potential pivots for Foggy Coast Brewing that leverage our brewing expertise and brand equity but adapt to this new reality. For each pivot, explain how it addresses the disruption while supporting our national expansion goals.
```

## Practical Tips for Ideation

1. **Embrace constraints**: The most creative solutions often emerge from tight constraints
2. **Quantity over quality**: Generate many ideas first, evaluate later
3. **Combine approaches**: Look for ways to merge elements from different scenarios
4. **Follow surprises**: Pay special attention to ideas that make you say "I never thought of that"
5. **Challenge sacred cows**: Question the fundamental assumptions about your business model
